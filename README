SRend
=====
This is a repository in which I put things related to rendering. I'm doing do
by writing pieces of a software renderer.

The idea is to build everything on top of SDL2. One of the reasons is that
I'd like to take this to windows later on and try it out (currently I'm only
on linux).

Programs
========
Each program is identified by having a directory of its own with its own
name.

  => DrawPoints
  =============
  Draws some points across a horizontal line. Extremely simple program merely
  to get on with drawing pixels with SDL2.

  => DrawLine_Bresenham
  =====================
  My first attempt at the Bresenham line drawing algorithm.

  The code was a bit messier, but it was actually cleaner than I expected.
  The largest issue was to make sure it worked for all cases and not just for
  when the line has a positive slope smaller than 1, which was how I learned
  the algorithm. This was largely due to a silly attention mistake (wrote x
  when I should have written y) that took me about half hour to find.

  It was very impressive how much the assertions helped in making the program
  work.

  => DrawCircles_DDA
  ==================
  My first attempt at the digital differential analysis algorithm for drawing
  circles.

  Largely, forgetting to round floating point values to the nearest integer
  value was what got me. The algorithm in general made sense without much of
  a trouble.

  There were some issues around finding that E value the book (Compute Graphics
  via Java) talks about. They were left unresolved. If I ever study
  rasterization algorithms again, which I intend to, I'll have another look at
  this.

XError
======
This code relies on XError. This is a error report handling library for C
programming that I'm currently working on. You can find more on it in here:
