SRend
=====
This is a repository in which I put things related to rendering. I'm doing do
by writing pieces of a software renderer.

The idea is to build everything on top of SDL2. One of the reasons is that
I'd like to take this to windows later on and try it out (currently I'm only
on linux).

Programs
========
+------------+
| DrawPoints |
+------------+
Draw some points across a horizontal line. Extremely simple program merely
to get on with drawing pixels with SDL2.

XError
======
This code relies on XError. This is a error report handling library for C
programming that I'm currently working on. You can find more on it in here:
